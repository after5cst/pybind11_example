# pybind11 sample Python extension

This project creates a file structure and sample Python module that
support pybind11, clang-format, and uses Python unit tests to
test the Python module.

More documentation for setup and deployment needs to be added,
but here is a quick start:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j8
make test
